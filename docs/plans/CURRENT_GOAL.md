# Current Goal

## Status: vision and design complete; scoping the architecture request (2026-09-04)

`docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md` reflects the mature vision recovered from BVET (the
second of two prior attempts at this project), refined across this whole
design pass: branding (HeartWord AI/Studio/Films/Illustrated, logo, trimmed
tagline), a first-class Character Creation & Editing Tool, Gemini Omni
1.1 Flash-style Draft Room cost-tiered generation, the full Illustrated
Scripture strategy recovered from prior Mark/Acts comic work, enriched
canonical-character rules, language/book/chapter navigation with undo/redo,
a two-level book/chapter storyboard model with multi-agent role-based shot
planning, producer notifications (including a WhatsApp self-message
channel), export/delivery tiers grounded in the real distribution path
(Android phones, YouTube, WhatsApp fan-out through village leaders,
Bluetooth/USB-C), a field review gate before that distribution (Ryan and a
native-Hatam-speaker review team), and an FCBH-rights gate on public
YouTube publication independent of that.

Design docs completed, per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Design principles":

- **Provider abstraction** — every media provider sits behind one interface;
  see `docs/design/media-generation.md`'s Draft Room design, now with a
  concrete review-outcome set (accept / retry / retry-modified / escalate
  provider / hold for human).
- **Automated media review** — an evolving, learned rubric (not a fixed
  checklist), seeded with concrete dimensions (canonical likeness, extra/
  malformed characters, mouth-sync, unwanted text, continuity); see
  `docs/design/automated-quality-control.md`.
- **Illustrated Scripture strategy** — recovered in full from a prior
  attempt's Mark/Acts comic work; see `docs/design/illustrated-scripture.md`.
  Included in the architecture but stays lower priority than HeartWord Films.
- **Canonical Characters** — recognition hierarchy, naming/identity safety,
  and a non-destructive candidate-review workflow; see
  `docs/design/canonical-characters.md`.
- **Character Creation & Editing Tool** — the tool's own workflow (starting
  a character, gap detection during shot planning, evolving an existing
  character, voice mapping and live test); see
  `docs/design/character-tool.md`.
- **Timeline and project identity** — language/book/chapter as the project
  key, typed-command edit history with undo/redo; see
  `docs/design/timeline.md`.
- **Shot planning as multi-agent collaboration** — book/chapter storyboards,
  a manual "Create Storyboard" trigger, role agents that interact (not just
  independently propose) with the interaction logged; see
  `docs/design/shot-planning.md`.
- **Producer notifications** — trigger events, channel options (email,
  Pushover/ntfy.sh, Twilio, native app/PWA, WhatsApp self-message), a
  cheap-first phased approach; see `docs/design/notifications.md`.
- **Working conventions for AI coding agents** — `AGENTS.md` now includes a
  "never infer requirements from code, ask Dan on ambiguity" rule and a
  Goal Guardian check (verify implementation against the vision/goal/
  workflow docs, not just tests), aimed directly at the 100-ticket failure
  mode from the prior attempt.

## v1 Scope (confirmed 2026-09-04)

The smallest slice that proves the whole loop end-to-end on one real
chapter, rather than architecting the full vision at once:

**In scope for v1:** one chapter, Hatam Mark 2 (the chapter with the
existing pilot to compare against), taken through all seven core pipeline
stages — ingestion/alignment, scene breakdown, casting & direction, media
generation, voice & lip-sync, assembly, and QC — to a reviewable rendered
cut in the editor. One provider per media type (no cross-provider
escalation yet). Casting & direction as a single planning pass rather than
the full multi-agent role negotiation. The Character Tool, built just far
enough to create and approve the handful of characters Mark 2 actually
needs. QC limited to the structural checks (sync drift, coverage, lip-sync
confidence) rather than the full evolving media-review rubric. A basic
running cost total rather than the full live/pending/reconciled ledger.

**Deliberately deferred, but the architecture should leave room for:** the
Draft Room's cost-tiered draft/escalate loop, the multi-agent shot-planning
negotiation and its log, the full evolving media-review rubric with
retry/escalate decision states, the complete cost-governance ledger,
producer notifications, book-level (vs. chapter-only) storyboards, and the
Illustrated Scripture lane entirely.

## Architecture (confirmed 2026-09-04)

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` now has the v1 architecture: a local web app
(React/TypeScript frontend, Node/TypeScript backend, both on Dan's
machine), TypeScript throughout rather than splitting with Python, SQLite
for structured data with generated media on the filesystem, a v1 directory
layout, a data model covering the core entities, queue-free stage
orchestration, and a provider interface whose result states already match
the QC review-outcome vocabulary. Runtime data (the SQLite file and
generated assets) lives at `C:\Users\danbr\HeartWordData\`, outside the
OneDrive-synced repo, configurable via `HEARTWORD_DATA_DIR`.

## Providers and schema (confirmed 2026-09-04)

v1 providers are locked in: Google Nano Banana / Nano Banana Pro (images),
Google Veo 3.1 Lite 720p/1080p (video), and Google Gemini Omni 1.1 (360p
draft tier, start/end-keyframe-guided generation, targeted region image
editing) — all one Gemini adapter under `GEMINI_API_KEY`; Kling.ai's Avatar
API (lip-sync) under `KLING_API_KEY_1`. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s
Provider interface section and `.env.example`. Voice/TTS is still open.

The v1 SQLite schema is written: `src/db/schema.sql` (projects, characters/
character_versions/character_assets, scenes/shots/shot_characters,
generation_attempts, clips, audio_segments/tracks, edit_commands,
cost_ledger_entries, review_notes). It deliberately mirrors BVET-Data's own
`identityId`/`scope`/region conventions so imported characters carry their
provenance rather than being re-modeled from scratch.

## Next up

- **BVET-Data asset import for Mark 2** — investigated; a concrete plan is
  pending Dan's confirmation before anything is copied. Findings: Mark 2's
  Hatam text and FCBH audio both exist and are ready to import as-is.
  Character canon is uneven — Jesus and Matthew/Levi are approved with rich
  Papuan reference sets; the paralytic is approved but thin (one image);
  the four friends, the principal scribe, and the eight witnesses exist
  only as unapproved single-image candidates; no Mark 2 chapter index was
  ever finished (only Mark 1's); no crowd archetype (Pharisees, generic
  disciples, tax collectors and sinners) exists yet for anyone. No
  `/claude-pilot` folder was found anywhere in BVET, BVET-Data, or
  BVET-Claude — flagged back to Dan rather than guessed at.
- Once the import plan is confirmed and assets land in `HeartWordData/`:
  actual implementation of the v1 pipeline can begin.

Out of scope for now: which subset of the illustrated-Scripture prior
attempt's assets to import — not needed until the Illustrated lane is
active, which is after v1.

## Lesson to keep applying

A prior attempt to fix BVET's issues fragmented into ~100 disconnected
tickets and lost the thread of the actual goal. Keep every piece of design
and implementation work traceable back to `docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md` rather
than letting a backlog of fixes become the de facto plan. The Goal Guardian
check in `AGENTS.md` exists specifically to catch this during
implementation; scoping a v1 before architecture exists to catch it one
step earlier.
